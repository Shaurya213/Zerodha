# Zerodha - India's #1 Stock Broker

This project is a full-stack web application that clones the functionality and design of **Zerodha**, India's leading stock brokerage platform. The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js (Node Package Manager)

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can start using this project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaurya213/Zerodha.git
   cd Zerodha
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
  
   npm install

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload if you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, visit Create React App Deployment.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.
All commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them as needed.

You don't have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature unless you're ready for customization.

Backend
For the backend, youâ€™ll need to set up a server that connects with the frontend. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.

Make sure to run the backend server before starting the frontend for full functionality.

Running the Backend Server
Navigate to the backend directory:

  ```bash
  cd backend
```

Install the backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Start the server:
```
npm start
```

Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:

Frontend:

React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React Router - Declarative routing for React
Axios - Promise-based HTTP client for making requests
Redux - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
Backend:

Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications
Express - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
MongoDB - NoSQL database (if applicable to your project)
